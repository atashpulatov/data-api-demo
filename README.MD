[![Build Status](https://jenkins.internal.microstrategy.com/buildStatus/icon?job=mstr-office-.-m2020-.-stage-1-dev)](https://jenkins.internal.microstrategy.com/view/mstr-office/view/m2020/job/mstr-office-.-m2020-.-stage-1-dev/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Office Online, Office 365, Office 2016 or later
* Node.js LTS
* ssh-key added to your github account (our project depends on 2nd repository, that we contribute, that contains reusable MicroStrategy React components)
To add key follow instructions on our [github](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)


### Installing

Start by cloning the repository:

```
git clone git@github.microstrategy.com:Kiai/mstr-office.git
```

Navigate to project folder and install dependencies

```
cd production
npm install
```

To start project just simply type

```
npm start
```

### Sideloading

#### Manifest file

To sideload our plugin on any of the platforms you will need manifest file. 
The file is being stored in mstr-react/production/office-react-manifest.xml
Below you can find information and links describe process of sideloading the add-in.

#### Office for Mac

You need to copy manifest file to Office location in Library like so
```
cp mstr-office/production/office-react-manifest.xml ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/documents/wef
```

Now you can run add-in using Insert -> My Add-ins. 
MicroStrategy for Office should appear under Developer Add-ins.
You may be required to accept self-signed certificate in order to start add-in.

Additional information can be found on [Microsoft page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-an-office-add-in-on-ipad-and-mac)

#### Office for Windows

#### Office Online

### Troubleshooting

#### Permission denied
```
git@github.microstrategy.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```
This means that you don't have ssh key added to ssh-agent. To fix this simply execute
```
ssh-add
```
Of you have key in some custom path you should provide the path as below
```
ssh-add /custom/path/to/ssh/key
```
#### Host verification failed
```
Host key verification failed.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```
This means that you don't have microstrategy.github.com added to known hosts. 
To fix it simply run
```
ssh github.microstrategy.com
The authenticity of host 'github.microstrategy.com (X.X.X.X)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:--------------------------------------------.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
``` 
Type **yes** when prompted.

#### Dossier or prompts are not working
Make sure embeddinglib.js is present in your environment.[More information](production/public/javascript/README.md).
