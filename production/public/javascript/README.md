# embeddinglib.js for local development

In order to use functionality such as prompts and dossier `embeddinglib.js` is required. This file is part of [embeded-bi-sdk](https://github.microstrategy.com/Kiai/embeded-bi-sdk).

This file is part of MicroStrategyLibrary and we just reference it in the code `../../javascript/embeddinglib.js`.

## Local development

To use dossier functionality in localhost (outside of MicroStrategyLibrary) create embeddinglib.js in `/production/public/javascript/`, and copy the code from a working environment (ideally same environment you are going to connect to).
